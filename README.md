## Search Engine

Built-in support for search engine: Bing, Google, SearXNG

#### SearXNG (Free, No Key required)

install [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) with [searxng-docker](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker)
> SearXNG is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from various search services and databases. The service does not track or profile its users, providing online anonymity for those who seek it. Additionally, SearXNG can be used over Tor for online anonymity.

When you install SearxNG, the only active output format by default is the HTML format. You need to activate the json format to use the API. This can be done by adding the following line to the settings.yml file:

```yaml
search:
    formats:
        - html
        - json
```

And set limiter to false:

```yaml
server:
   limiter: false # default is true
```

You can also set the host in .env:

```shell
# SEARXNG_HOSTNAME=<host>
```

#### Bing Search

To use the Bing Web Search API, please visit [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api) to obtain your Bing subscription key.
> The Bing Search API is billed, but has a free tier of 1000 calls per month.

#### Google Search

You have three options for Google Search: you can use the SearchApi Google Search API from [SearchApi](https://www.searchapi.io/), [Serper](https://www.serper.dev/) Google Search API from Serper, or opt for the [Programmable Search Engine](https://developers.google.com/custom-search) provided by Google.
